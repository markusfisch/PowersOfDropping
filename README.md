<img src="svg/screenshot-630x500.jpg" alt="Screenshot"/>

In this game, you have the power to drop blocks!

Connect lines or columns of blocks to remove them.
Clear all blocks or hit all catchers to win!

For the [js13kGames][js13kGames] challenge of [Gamedev.js Jam 2024][gdjam].
The theme was "Power".

You can play the original submission [here][play] or the slightly improved
post-compo version [here][postplay].

Use the cursor keys (or hjkl) to move and SPACE to drop a block.

Works on your phone, too. There are on-screen controls.

## Build Requirements

[esbuild][esbuild] is used for minification. You can get it with `npm`:

	$ npm install --global esbuild
